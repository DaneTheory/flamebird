# Flamebird.js
  
Wonderful task runner, works in the command line and also have own webview.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g flamebird

## How it works
 
  After installing `flamebird`, open command line in your project folder<br>
  and write `flamebird`. After that, flamebird takes your `Procfile` or if<br>
  you don't have Procfile then flamebird takes your `package.json` and <br>
  by default will be use `start` script
